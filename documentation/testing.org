* Testing
** Backend
*** e2e testing
Decided to use httpie instead of Postman to automate testing. Also, been meaning to move away from bash for anything other than small unix scripts. Will use Python due to his ability to call subprocesses.

- Currently relearning Python to use for [[https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-run-unix-commands-in-your-python-program--cms-25926][bash scripting]] instead
- Need to figure out Poetry env
- Use a [[https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/builtin_types.html][strongly typed]] python style

** Frontend
*** Unit testing
Using Cypress
*** E2e testing
Cypres
*** Code Coverage
